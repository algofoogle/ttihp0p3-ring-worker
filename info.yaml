# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        Ring Oscillator Worker
  author:       algofoogle (Anton Maurovic)
  discord:      algofoogle
  description:  Simple digital logic, doing work, driven by a ring oscillator
  language:     Verilog
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_algofoogle_ro_worker"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# This section is for the datasheet/website. Use descriptive names (e.g., RX, TX, MOSI, SCL, SEG_A, etc.).

  uio[2]: "mode"        # IN: Sampled as last byte is shifted in: 0=limited cycles; 1=stop on falling edge of 'stop'
  uio[3]: "stop"        # IN: Used with mode==1: stop the worker.

  uio[5]: ""
  uio[6]: "done"        # OUT: Goes high when result can be shifted back out.
  uio[7]: "cdebug"      # OUT: Clock debug; internal clock source divided by 16.
