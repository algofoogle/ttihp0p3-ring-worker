## How it works

An internal simple digital counter block can be driven by an external clock or an internal ring oscillator, and then be fed data through external pins. It will run as fast as it can to try and produce a result, which can then be read back out.


## How to test

1.  Set `clock_sel`=1 (internal ring oscillator is used as the clock source). Ring-osc clock, divided by 16, should be present on `cdebug` -- expected to be on the order of 12.5MHz to 25MHz.
2.  Set `mode`=0 (we're going to load the number of cycles for which we want the worker to run).
3.  Assert reset. No need to supply a clock on `clk`. Expect `done==0`. 
4.  Load a sequence of 4 bytes: a rising edge on `shift` loads each byte, in turn, via `din[7:0]`. First 2 bytes are a starting value (MSB first). The next 2 bytes are a cycle count. In `mode==0` this cycle count is used, while in `mode==1` it is repurposed an addend for an adder experiment.
5.  After the 4th byte has been loaded, the worker should start, and set `done==1` when it finishes.
6.  Shift out 4 bytes via `dout[7:0]` by raising `shift` each time again (which in turn loads 4 more bytes, so it will start again). The first 2 bytes out are the internal counter value (which started at 0) and the last 2 bytes are the 'starting value' incremented by the counter value (i.e. it should be the starting value, plus the internal counter value).


## External hardware

Nothing special. Probably just an oscilloscope to see how fast it actually yields a result.
